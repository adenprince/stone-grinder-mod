# Stone Grinder
The Stone Grinder mod is a Minecraft mod built with Fabric that adds a Grinder block, which includes utility recipes for building blocks. Unused building materials can be recycled into other blocks, and sand is made renewable.

## Usage
To craft a Grinder block, surround an iron ingot in the center slot with cobblestone in a crafting table. The Grinder block is powered by fuel, similar to a furnace. Blocks take 5 seconds to grind.

## Grinding Recipes
- Stone, Stone Brick Variants -> Cobblestone
- Deepslate, Polished Deepslate, Deepslate Brick Variants -> Cobbled Deepslate
- Gilded Blackstone, Polished Blackstone Variants -> Blackstone
- Cobblestone, Mossy Cobblestone, Cobbled Deepslate, Blackstone -> Gravel
- Gravel, Sandstone Variants, Terracotta Variants (that don't grind to red sand) -> Sand
- Red Sandstone Variants, Magenta/Orange/Pink/Purple/Red Terracotta -> Red Sand
- Concrete -> Respective Concrete Powder
- Polished/Smooth Basalt -> Basalt
- Polished Andesite/Diorite/Granite -> Andesite/Diorite/Granite

- Prismarine Bricks -> Prismarine

This mod has compatibility with the Roughly Enough Items mod for viewing Grinder block recipes.

# Stone Grinder
The Stone Grinder mod is a Minecraft mod built with Fabric that adds a Grinder block, which includes utility recipes for building blocks. Unused building materials can be recycled into other blocks, and sand is made renewable.

## Usage
To craft a Grinder block, surround an iron ingot in the center slot with cobblestone in a crafting table. The Grinder block is powered by fuel, similar to a furnace. Blocks take 5 seconds to grind.

## Grinding Recipes
- Stone/Stone Brick Variants -> Cobblestone
- Cobblestone/Mossy Cobblestone -> Gravel
- Gravel/Sandstone Variants -> Sand
- Red Sandstone Variants -> Red Sand
- Concrete -> Respective Concrete Powder

This mod has compatibility with the Roughly Enough Items mod for viewing Grinder block recipes.
